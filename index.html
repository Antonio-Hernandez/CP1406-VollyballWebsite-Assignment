            <h3>Who can play?</h3>
            <p>There are 800 million players worldwide who play volleyball at least once a week. Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness. Since you don’t have to move around the court too much, it’s great for people who want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit without pushing them to their limit. For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is fantastic because games can be really exciting and intense, but there’s always a net between you and your opponents. <br>
            Beach volleyball is suitable for people of all ages, and men and women alike. <br>
            Anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program should see their doctor first.
